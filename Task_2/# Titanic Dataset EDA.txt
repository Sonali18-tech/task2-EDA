# Titanic Dataset EDA

This repository contains a Python script that performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a cleaned version of the Titanic dataset. It uses powerful data visualization libraries to uncover insights about survival rates, passenger demographics, and fare distributions.

## Dataset

The script expects a **cleaned dataset** named:

cleaned_titanic.csv

## Features and Visualizations:

* Basic dataset summary and statistics
* Survival count plot
* Age and fare distributions
* Survival by passenger class (Pclass)
* Boxplots:

  * Age vs Survival
  * Fare vs Pclass
* Correlation matrix heatmap
* Pairplot of key features
* Interactive Plotly scatter plot for Age vs Fare colored by Survival

## How to Run

Simply run the script using any Python IDE or from the terminal:

Make sure `cleaned_titanic.csv` is in the same folder.

## Requirements

* pandas
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* plotly

## Key Insights
- Females and first-class passengers had higher survival rates.
- Children had better survival chances.
- Fare is correlated with survival.
- Age and Cabin had missing values.
- Pclass 1 had the highest survival rate.
- Fare and Survival show a slight positive correlation.
- Sex_male (inverse correlation) indicates females survived more.
- Age distribution shows more survivors were younger on average.

## Sample Output

* Survival Count Barplot
* Age Distribution Histogram
* Fare Distribution Histogram
* Survival by Class
* Correlation Heatmap
* Interactive Plot: Age vs Fare by Survival
